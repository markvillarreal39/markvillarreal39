## About Me 🚀

I'm a passionate **open source contributor and supporter** who believes that collaboration builds the best tools. I actively contribute to community-driven projects and also sponsor developers making meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem.

My goal is to be part of a global network of makers and maintainers — building cool stuff, learning in public, and supporting each other through code and contribution.

- 🌱 Currently learning: **Backend systems, automation, and DevOps workflows**
- 🔭 Working on: **Open source CLI tools, automation utilities, and GitHub Actions**
- 🌍 Languages: **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, English, Spanish**
- 📫 Reach me: **markvillarreal39@outlook.com**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I think open source is the best kind of social network.
